#Burrows_Wheeler_transform
The Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters.
This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs
of repeated characters by techniques such asmove-to-front transform and run-length encoding.
